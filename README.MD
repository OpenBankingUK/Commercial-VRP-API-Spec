# cVRP OpenAPI specification - DRAFT

This repository contains the cVRP Swagger file which is based on the [Open Banking VRP API Specification](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs).

## OpenAPI specification files

Pending further review, the repo currently contains 2 versions of the cVRP Spec:

### Alignment to the MLA via mandatory fields

- [Mandatory fields - cVRP OpenAPI 3.0 - YAML](./Mandatory-alignment/cvrp-openapi.yaml)
- [Mandatory fields - cVRP OpenAPI 3.0 - JSON](./Mandatory-alignment/cvrp-openapi.json)  

Changelog for the mandatory field approach: [CHANGELOG.MD](./Mandatory-alignment/CHANGELOG.MD)

### Alignment to the MLA via conditional fields

- [Conditional fields - cVRP OpenAPI 3.0 - YAML](./Conditional-alignment/cvrp-openapi.yaml)
- [Conditional fields - cVRP OpenAPI 3.0 - JSON](./Conditional-alignment/cvrp-openapi.json)  

Changelog for the conditional field approach: [CHANGELOG.MD](./Conditional-alignment/CHANGELOG.MD)

## Releases and change management

Version numbers will align to OBL VRP releases/updates with the initial release being tagged as cVRP v4.0 Swagger Update 4.  This ensures clarity on which version of the OBL API specification a release is based on.

The `main` branch will always reflect the current release, with both current and past releases available to download in the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/Commercial-VRP-API-Spec/releases) section.
