# cVRP OpenAPI specification

This repository contains the cVRP Swagger file which is based on the [Open Banking VRP API Specification](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-specs).

## Releases and change management

Version numbers will align to OBL VRP releases/updates with the initial release being tagged as cVRP v4.0 Swagger Update 4.  This ensures clarity on which version of the OBL API specification a release is based on.

The `main` branch will always reflect the current release, with both current and past releases available to download in the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/Commercial-VRP-API-Spec/releases) section.
